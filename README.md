Geant4-web
==========

A web interface for using Geant4 for radiation simulations
The goal of this is to allow anyone to run radiation protection simulations without having to do all the work involved with setting up Geant4 and running it. Right now what needs to be done is sending the necessary data, graphing the data, displaying what the user has chosen, and maybe an interactive loading screen for the user to play with while their input is being processed. 
This is to allow others to better participate in NASA's Exploration Design Challenge for this year.
This site is currently written in AngularJS and the server side will probably be written in Python or Node.js.
